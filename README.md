# gulp-font-blast

> Convert an svg font file to svg symbol definition

If you haven't used [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the
[Getting Started](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-started)
guide - it explains how to create a [gulpfile](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#create-a-gulpfile).
You may also check out [API documentation](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md#gulp-api-docs)
of Gulp or search for other Gulp [plugins](http://gulpjs.com/plugins/). Once you're familiar with that process,
you may install this plugin with this command:
```shell
npm install gulp-font-blast --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside of your `gulpfile` with this line of JavaScript:
```javascript
gulp.task('font-blast', function() {
    // TBD
});
```
